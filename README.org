* Binary5 keyboard
** objective
Developing 5-bit binary input keyboard, which works only by a left hand for text input.

** proof of concept
+ create a key code table for 5-bit input
+ develop a prototype model
+ develop a simple training software
+ train myself
+ check if I can reach practically usable speed to input text
+ If no, the project ends.  If yes, continue to create a model for my daily use.

** pre-release history
*** 2023-12
It was difficult to input come codes which needs to lift the third finger.
So, made the third finger pad a little down as the next,

*** 2023-11
Create a key code table
+ 5 bits can make 32 codes.
+ 00000 is delimiter.
+ 00001,00010,00100,01000,10000 are modifier.
+ 26 codes are left, and it is just enough for 26 alphabet characters.
+ Do a little research about the frequency of the letters.

Develop a prototype model
5-bit touch key input.

Use adafruit FT232H(i2c) board + AT42QT1070(touch sensor) board

AT42QT1070 board needs a little modification to use i2c mode.

At first create the touch pad as the next pictures,

It suffered a lot with cross talk noise.
So, modified as the next,
